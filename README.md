# Enno Text Annotator
A web-based visual text annotation tool, which hopefully is less painful to use...

Frontend inspired by [TextAE](https://github.com/pubannotation/textae), you may find some code taken from there.

## Usage

## Why that name?
I needed an annotation tool to annotate emails in the [Enron Corpus](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./enron/).
