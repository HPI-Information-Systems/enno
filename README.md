# Enno Text Annotator
A web-based visual text annotation tool, which hopefully is less painful to use...

## Usage

### Installation
```bash
pip install Flask, email
npm install
grunt dist
grunt flask
```

## Why that name?
I needed an annotation tool to annotate emails in the [Enron Corpus](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./enron/).

## Other tools
- [TextAE](https://github.com/pubannotation/textae), nice, but bloated codebase
- [brat](https://github.com/nlplab/brat), very common, but buggy and frustrating to use
- [Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14ionbRVYBQuD0cNLazKfRWYzrkax3qFCspm9SiaG5Aw/edit) of lots of annotation tools
